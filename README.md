# Quill
Version: 1.0.3 Beta
![Introducing Quill](http://cdn.kleverr.com/pjx/quill/img/demo/quill-screenshot-10.jpg)

Quill is a sleek, modern and _clutter-free_ blog theme for [MODX](http://modx.com) that offers a more immersive reading experience. In just a few clicks, you'll have a fully functioning blogâ€”thanks to MODX package dependencies.

## Demo
Quill is best previewed on the following pages:
1. [Live demo blog](http://quill.kleverr.modxcloud.com)
2. [Pattern Library](http://quill.kleverr.modxcloud.com/pattern-library/)
3. [Flight Manual](http://quill.kleverr.modxcloud.com/flight-manual/)

## Who is it for?
Quill is a One-Stop blogging solution for MODX that's designed to quickly get you in writing mode. By taking care of the heavy lifting, it allows you to focus on what matters most to you: Publishing your thoughts.

## Requirements

**MODX 2.4+** (Quill [installs](http://quill.kleverr.modxcloud.com/flight-manual/) required extras via package dependencies)

## Installation

1. [Download](http://modx.com/extras/package/quill) Quill via Package Management.
2. Click Install and follow the instructions.
3. Clear Cache.
4. Turn on Friendly URLs. (+ Rename the `ht.access` file to `.htaccess`)

## Upgrading
As of version **1.0.4 Beta**, Quill's transport package name has changed from `quill-x.x.x-release.transport.zip` to `quill2-x.x.x-release.transport.zip`. This helps avoid conflict with another unrelated extra. This should also take care of an issue preventing Quill from showing up in the installer. Before upgrading, you should back up your blog if upgrading from versions prior to **1.0.4 Beta**, as the upgrade  may duplicate data.
