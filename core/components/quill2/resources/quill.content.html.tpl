[[-
 This container is only used to group Quill's blog resources
 to avoid any possible name conflicts with your existing resources.
 We recommend that you move Quill's resources to the top level of the site tree
 once you've resolved any name conflicts you may have.

 If you prefer to keep your Quill blog on a separate directory, then the current
 setup is perfect.
